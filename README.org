#+title: lune programming language

The only change is that you can't define global variables like this
#+begin_src lua
x = 10
#+end_src

you have to use ~global~ keyword instead.
#+begin_src lune
global x = 10;
#+end_src

and I'm planing to make the semicolon optional.

* I wrote this while the lights are off
Idk if i should hoist global variables or not.
#+begin_src lune
global const Z = 10;
var x = 10; -- local
global y = 69;
#+end_src

to

#+begin_src lua
_G.Z = 10
_.y = 69
local x = 10
#+end_src
